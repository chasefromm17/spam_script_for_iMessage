# Spam Script for iMessage

**REQUIRES IMESSAGE APP ON OS X/MACOS SIERRA/MACOS HIGH SIERRA OR MACOS MOJAVE**
**REQUIRES APPLESCRIPT**

Updated for enhanced improvements. Sorry for the wait.

**Tested on**: Tested on macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra, confirmed working **perfectly** on both software releases.

**NOTICE FOR MACOS MOJAVE USERS**: This script was NOT tested on macOS Mojave. Please either test yourself or just allow for adequate testing with due time on my end. I need to buy an MacBook Pro 2014 and 15" to test with macOS Mojave installed before I can test it with AppleScript, Xcode, iMessage, etc. anyway for Christmas and if you can wait, that'd be appreciated. If not, two tears in a bucket.

**Description**: This script is really just for those times when somebody is just seriously agitating you in a single iMessage thread and you've had enough of it and just want to pull their hair out basically and essentially just give them what's called an "iMessage/Internet slap in the face", so to speak... It was used to send hate, which was used in EverythingApplePro's "iOS 10.3 beta 6" video on YouTube just to show the level of agitation of when stupid people start sending pizzas and garbage food to your house (not demonstrate what *really* happens when you mess with me), and not to show hate against Filip, just trying to make him broadcast to the world that I'm upset and the harassment from these stupid "people" on Twitter who were sending shit to my house was not okay (FYI, none of this is lost on me, I'm a clever person who's just tired of harassment from stupid people online. I just used him to demonstrate the pain I go through with them. That's all...)
